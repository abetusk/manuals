Notes
===

Recommended water temperature is 120 deg F (48.8c).

[From](https://www.weather.gov/marfc/WaterTemperatureTables) it looks like the water
table is about 60deg F.

Looking at the RTEX-27, that gives about 3 gallons per minute (GPM) to get to about 120deg F.

This Rheem model looks to not have a flow regulator but one can be installed on the outside
(RTE10001A w/ 1/2" NPT and RTE10001B w/ 3/4" NPT).

Note that the Powerstart AE125 has 3/4" NPT.
